## Story
<!-- provide background and context for why we decided to make PillPal (besides it being for our capstone class). who is our target audience? why does our product matter and what new aspects does it bring to the smart pill bottle market? -->
Taking medication is an essential part of maintaining health for millions of people worldwide. However, up to 50% of people take their medication incorrectly. Missing pills or not being able to find your medication are problems that those who rely on prescription medications face. Out of all current smart pill bottles on the market, PillPal offers the simplest, low-effort solution for managing and keeping track of multiple medications. Simply open the lid for the app to track when you've taken your medication - no additional button presses or phone taps needed!
