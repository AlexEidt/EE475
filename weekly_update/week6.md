## Recap
This week we finished the draft of our "Kickstarter" page, and continued developing the app.

### Individual Contributions
Everyone worked on the project status presentation. Here are some individual contributions for this week:

- **Alex**: Researched database options for Flutter applications to store the state of the application, made minor tweaks to the app for better user interaction, completed (current) code documentation.
- **Edward**: Pyhsically worked on adapting the initial circuit to fit in the pill bottle, tested the Arduino Micro's low power mode and its interaction with the BLE module.
- **Peter**: Redesigned 3D pill bottle for better user accessibility and easier assembly, 3D printed bottle.
- **Sunny**: Updated Figma UI mock-up with additional pages and clearer functionality, wrote weekly update.

## To-Do
- Combine circuit with 3D printed bottle
- Implement reading and processing Bluetooth packets in UI
- Write interrupt for lid open detection to toggle Bluetooth module
