## Recap
This week, we formed a group and began [brainstorming ideas](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1wSQKRsUCjLFwf4-i_ToyM_h7l0vrMOncRP-5_4R-B2w/edit?usp=sharing). We ultimately settled on PillPal, a pill bottle which lets users keep track of their bottle's location and record the history of how frequently the bottle has been opened.
